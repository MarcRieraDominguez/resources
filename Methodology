- Interesting Twitter thread on [common mistakes in meta-analyses](https://twitter.com/rrarroca/status/1786186734633414841), and [guidelines and resources to carry out meta-analyses](https://twitter.com/Ed_pheasant/status/1789268392358060535), and a [nice visualization](https://x.com/MatthewBJane/status/1808278216831861033/photo/1) of random-effects meta-analysis.

- A [reflection](https://thehardestscience.com/2018/11/02/data-analysis-is-thinking-data-analysis-is-theorizing/) on how data analysis and theoretical thinking are intertwined.
- An [overview](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/07/30/gam/) of Generalized Additive Models, including a comparison of packages `gam` and `mgcv`.
- Multiple options to [extract data points from a graph](https://plotdigitizer.com/best-plot-digitizer), apparently with better options than DataThief.
- A recurring issue in Generalized Linear Mixed Models, is convergence issues, parituclarly with many fixed effeccts and/or complex random structures. In the case of the glmmTMNB package, an option would be to [change the optimizer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73135114/convergence-criteria-in-glmmtmb-what-are-my-options), although maybe they are [not an increase in speed](https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/issues/359).

Causality, strutural equation models, path analysis
